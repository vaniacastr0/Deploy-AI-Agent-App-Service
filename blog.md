## **Deploy Your First Azure AI Agent Service on Azure App Service**

### **1. Introduction**
Azure AI Agent Service is a fully managed service designed to empower developers to securely build, deploy, and scale high-quality, extensible AI agents without needing to manage the underlying compute and storage resources[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview). These AI agents act as "smart" microservices that can answer questions, perform actions, or automate workflows by combining generative AI models with tools that allow them to interact with real-world data sources[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview).

Deploying Azure AI Agent Service on Azure App Service offers several benefits:
- **Scalability**: Azure App Service provides automatic scaling options to handle varying loads.
- **Security**: Built-in security features ensure that your AI agents are protected.
- **Ease of Deployment**: Simplified deployment processes allow developers to focus on building and improving their AI agents rather than managing infrastructure[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview).

### **2. Prerequisites**
Before you begin deploying Azure AI Agent Service on Azure App Service, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Azure Subscription**: You need an active Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can create a free account on the Azure portal[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart).

2. **Azure AI Foundry Access**: Azure AI Foundry is the platform where you create and manage your AI agents. Ensure you have access to Azure AI Foundry and have the necessary permissions to create hubs and projects[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart).

3. **Basic Knowledge of Azure App Service**: Familiarity with Azure App Service is essential for configuring and deploying your AI agent. Understanding the basics of resource groups, app services, and hosting plans will be beneficial[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart).

4. **Development Environment**: Set up your development environment with the required tools and SDKs. This includes:
	- **Azure CLI**: For managing Azure resources from the command line.
	- **Azure AI Foundry SDK**: For creating and managing AI agents.
	- **Code Editor**: Such as Visual Studio Code, for writing and editing your deployment scripts.

### **3. Setting Up Azure AI Agent Service**

To harness the capabilities of Azure AI Agent Service, follow these steps to set up the environment:

**a. Create an Azure AI Hub and Project**

Begin by establishing an AI Hub and initiating a new project within Azure AI Foundry:

1. **Access Azure Portal:** Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your Azure credentials.

2. **Create AI Hub:**
   - Navigate to the search bar and search for "AI Foundry"
   - Select "AI Foundry" and click "Create" and select "Hub".
   - Provide necessary details such as subscription, resource group, region, name and connect AI services.
   - Review and create the AI Hub.

3. **Create a Project:**
   - Within the newly created AI Hub, click "Launch Azure AI Foundry"
   - Under your new AI Hub, click "New project" and click "Create".

**b. Deploy an Azure OpenAI Model**

With the project in place, deploy a suitable AI model:

1. **Model Deployment:**
	- On the left-hand side of the project panel, select "Models + Endpoints" and click "Deploy model"
	- Select "Deploy base model" and choose "gpt-4o" and click "Confirm"
	- Leave the default settings and click "Deploy"

Detailed guidance is available in the [Quickstart documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart).

### **4. Developing the AI Agent**

After setting up the environment and deploying the model, proceed to develop the AI agent:

**a. Define Your AI Agent**

On the left-hand side of the project panel, select "Agents".
Click "New agent" and the default agent will be created which already connected to your Azure OpenAI model.

1. **Define Instructions:**
   - Craft clear and concise instructions that guide the agent's interactions. For example:
     ```python
     instructions = "You are a helpful assistant capable of answering queries and performing tasks."
     ```

2. **Integrate Tools:**
   - Incorporate tools to enhance the agent's capabilities, such as:
     - **Code Interpreter:** Allows the agent to execute code for data analysis.
     - **OpenAPI Tools:** Enable the agent to interact with external APIs.
   - Enabling Code Interpreter tool:
     - Still on the agent settings, in the "Actions" section, click "Add"
     ```python
     from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient, CodeInterpreterToolDefinition

     project_client = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(conn_str="Your_Connection_String")

     code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterToolDefinition()
     tools = [code_interpreter]
     ```

**b. Create and Configure the Agent**

Utilize the Azure AI Foundry SDK to instantiate and set up the agent:

1. **Initialize the Agent:**
   ```python
   agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(
       model="gpt-4o-mini",
       name="my-agent",
       instructions=instructions,
       tools=tools,
   )
   ```


2. **Set Up Threads and Messages:**
   - Create a thread to manage conversations:
     ```python
     thread = project_client.agents.create_thread()
     ```
   - Add messages to the thread:
     ```python
     message = project_client.agents.create_message(
         thread_id=thread.id,
         role="user",
         content="Hello, how can you assist me today?",
     )
     ```

**c. Test Agent Functionality**

Ensure the agent operates as intended:

1. **Run the Agent:**
   ```python
   run = project_client.agents.create_and_process_run(thread_id=thread.id, agent_id=agent.id)
   ```


2. **Review Responses:**
   - Retrieve messages to assess the agent's replies:
     ```python
     messages = project_client.agents.list_messages(thread_id=thread.id)
     for msg in messages:
         print(f"{msg.role}: {msg.content}")
     ```

     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
     pip install flask
     ```

2. **Develop the Application:**

   - Create an `app.py` file with the following content:

     ```python
     from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
     import openai

     app = Flask(__name__)

     # Initialize OpenAI API
     openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

     @app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
     def chat():
         user_input = request.json.get('message')
         response = openai.Completion.create(
             engine="davinci",
             prompt=user_input,
             max_tokens=150
         )
